# HBN stability similarity
## subject lists
Data were downloaded from http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/, releases 1-4. To be included, subjects had to be from either the Cornell or Rutgers site, have data from all four functional runs (Rest1, Rest2, MovieDM, MovieTP), and have a mean framewise displacement of less than 0.3mm in each run.  Subject lists here for the HBN-210 cohort, mean age 12.9 +/- 3.6 years, 69 females. For the behavioral cohort, subjects from HBN-210 were selected that also had behavioral measures for the WISC, the SRS and the CBCL (n=119).  
## supplementary materials
A previously defined 200-cluster parcellation ([Craddock et al., 2011](https://ccraddock.github.io/cluster_roi/atlases.html)) was used to generate whole-brain connectomes. Cluster membership within the 7 Yeo networks is given in [cluster-network_key.csv](cluster-network_key.csv)
