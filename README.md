# HBN_stability_similarity
subject lists and supplementary materials
Data were downloaded from http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/, releases 1-4. To be included, subjects had to be from either the Cornell or Rutgers site, have data from all four functional runs (Rest1, Rest2, MovieDM, MovieTP), and have a mean framewise displacement of less than 0.3mm in each run.  Subject lists here for the HBN-210 cohort, mean age 12.9 +/- 3.6 years, 69 females. For the behavioral cohort, subjects from HBN-210 were selected that also had behavioral measures for the WISC, the SRS and the CBCL (n=119).
